# Welcome to Igovote!

Igovote and is designed to renew hope amongst citizens, especially in the African region where there is a lack of transparency in the vote-counting process. In so doing the app features a holistic list of candidates contesting for positions right from the federal level down to grassroots offices. Provide a way for users to get real-time polling unit feedback to help deal with long lines and overcrowding and logistical issues at the polling centers. It also helps with transparency as candidates can upload results has votes are being counted at their polling units and a proper consolidation of those results is done by the app to match those results with official results and determine if the polls were free and fair
